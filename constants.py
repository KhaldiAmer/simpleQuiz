Eminem - Lose yourself
His palms are [TO_BE_FILLED_1], knees weak, arms are [TO_BE_FILLED_2]
There's vomit on his sweater [TO_BE_FILLED_3], mom's spaghetti 
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' 
What he wrote down, the whole [TO_BE_FILLED_4] goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out """

Eminem - Not afraid.
You can try and read my lyrics off of this [TO_BE_FILLED_1] before I lay 'em
But you won't take the [TO_BE_FILLED_2] out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do [TO_BE_FILLED_3], I [TO_BE_FILLED_4] it """

Eminem - rap god
Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your [TO_BE_FILLED_1]
But I'm only going to get this one [TO_BE_FILLED_2]
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to [TO_BE_FILLED_3], but I don't know what
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You were just what the [TO_BE_FILLED_4] ordered """
